Just discovered HuggingFace yesterday, am surprised at how potentially easy it could be to perform decently complex deep learning experiments these days (they tell you a lot of the practicals of what you need to know about any model, and they index things incredibly well and invitingly, they provide datasets as well as detailed descriptions of them with examples in a clean interface, and they might even provide the model files).

The whole thing gives me anxiety somehow. Cynically, the reason is because there's no excuse anymore to not do the work, because the perfect tools exist. Maybe I feel bad implicitly comparing myself to those people who have been making progress using the perfect tools. Maybe I feel bad implicitly comparing myself to the people who actually made the tools, and thoroughly solved an actual problem for a community of people, which I feel unable to do (why? maybe because I have some bad experiences trying to figure out how to balance tradeoffs, maybe just because of my old work, maybe because of perfectionism).
