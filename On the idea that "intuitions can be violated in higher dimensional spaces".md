This is mostly a landing page to connect examples of this happening.

There is always the fun sphere example, found in several places on the internet:
- https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~strohmer/courses/180BigData/180lecture1.pdf
	- This one also has some things to say about statistics. `certain random fluctuations are very well controlled in high dimensions and the success of asymptotic methods, used widely in mathematical statistics and statistical physics, which suggest that statements about very high-dimensional settings may be made where moderate dimensions would be too complicated.)`
- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2930015/spheres-cause-contradictions-in-dimensions-10-and-more
- TODO: how rare are true local optima in high dimensional spaces?
- In Anthropic's paper on the [superposition hypothesis](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#motivation) , they mention that the [JL lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma) says you can have exp(n) nearly orthogonal vectors (less than epsilon mutual dot product) in a vector space of high dimension n.
